Security+ certified student at Wayne State College pursuing a B.S. in Networking/Cybersecurity with a minor in Computer Science. I am actively using virtual machines such as Kali, Debian, Windows 11, and Windows 7 to practice penetration testing techniques and simulate attack scenarios along with my PenTest+ studies, I plan to take the PenTest+ exam before I graduate in May. I use this GitHub to document my hands-on projects, and track my journey as I work towards a career in Cybersecurity. 
## Objective

My studies in Networking and Cybersecurity have shown me this is an industry I want to contribute to and make a difference. I aspire to become a Pentester and to spread Cybersecurity awareness whenever possible.
