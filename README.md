Senior at Wayne State College pursuing a B.S. in Networking/Cybersecurity with a minor in Computer Science. I am actively using virtual machines such as Kali Linux, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019 Active Directory to practice penetration testing techniques and simulate attack scenarios along with my PenTest+ studies. I passed the Security+ exam in November of 2025, and I am currently preparing to take the PenTest+ Exam before graduating in May.

## Objective

My studies in Networking and Cybersecurity have shown me this is an industry I want to contribute to and make a difference. I aspire to become a Pentester and to spread Cybersecurity awareness whenever possible.
